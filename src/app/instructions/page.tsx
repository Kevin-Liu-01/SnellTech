          {`Eye charts measure only visual acuity, which is just one component of
          good vision. They cannot determine if your eyes are "working overtime"
          (needing to focus more than normal, which can lead to headaches and
          eye strain) or can they determine if your eyes work properly as a team
          for clear, comfortable binocular vision and accurate depth perception.
          Eye charts also cannot detect serious eye problems such as glaucoma or
          early diabetic retinopathy that could lead to serious vision
          impairment and even blindness. Only a comprehensive eye exam performed
          by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist can determine if your
          eyes are healthy and you are seeing as clearly and comfortably as
          possible.`}

          {`During the Covid-19 pandemic, home visual acuity testing became an
          important part of telemedicine for eye care. A variety of home tests
          are available in print, on smartphone apps or the internet. These
          tests have been found to be almost as accurate as a test performed in
          a provider's office. No special preparation is necessary for this
          test. There is no discomfort. `}

            Why the Test is Performed
          </Heading>
          The visual acuity test is a routine part of an eye examination or
          general physical examination, particularly if there is a change in
          vision or a problem with vision. In children, the test is performed to
          screen for vision problems. Vision problems in young children can
          often be corrected or improved. Undetected or untreated problems may
          lead to permanent vision damage.

          <Heading className="mb-2 font-optiker">Normal Results</Heading>
          Visual acuity is expressed as a fraction. The top number refers to the
          distance you stand from the chart. The bottom number indicates the
          distance at which a person with normal eyesight could read the same
          line you correctly read. Even if you miss one or two letters on the
          smallest line you can read, you are still considered to have vision
          equal to that line.
